=== Video Previewer ===

Cross-platform python tool which generates a video's index preview with
multiple screen capture thumbnails. You can see an example of what the preview
might look like by viewing the "example.png" file.

The script supports two backends for capturing video thumbnails, the user can
choose between using GStreamer (default) or MPlayer. The final preview image is
generated with ImageMagick currently.

The script is based off of the dhyana.pl script by Toby Inkster found here:

=== Usage ===

./video_previewer.py [options] file [file ...]

== Options ==
    --version             show program's version number and exit
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -v, --verbose         Print more detalied information
    -q, --quiet           Refrain from outputing anything
    --path-convert=PATH_CONVERT
                          Specify own path for 'convert' application (optional)
    --path-montage=PATH_MONTAGE
                          Specify own path for 'montage' application (optional)
    -b BACKEND, --backend=BACKEND
                          Backend used to capture images from video. Possible
                          values are 'gstreamer' (default) and 'mplayer'. The
                          gstreamer backend is recommended because it is faster,
                          has better support for video formats and more
                          correctly determines thumbnail timestamps.

== Capture options ==
    -r GRID_ROWS, --rows=GRID_ROWS
                        Number of rows the generated grid should contain
                        (default 6).
    -c GRID_COLS, --cols=GRID_COLS, --columns=GRID_COLS
                        Number of columns the generated grid should contain
                        (default 4).
    -t TITLE, --title=TITLE
                        Title for the thumbnail (video's name is default).
    -W THUMBNAIL_WIDTH, --width=THUMBNAIL_WIDTH
                        The width of a single image in the grid in pixels.
    -H THUMBNAIL_HEIGHT, --height=THUMBNAIL_HEIGHT
                        The height of a single image in the grid in pixels. If
                        only one of the width and height argument are
                        specified, the other one will be determined so that
                        the aspect ratio of the movie is preserved.
    -S GRID_SPACING, --spacing=GRID_SPACING
                        The space between images in the grid in pixels.
                        (default 4)
    --focus=CAPTURE_FOCUS
                        Focus on the beginning or the ending of the movie.
                        That means a greater number of thumbnails will be
                        generated in the specified area than in the other
                        part. For example if the focus is on the beginning of
                        the movie, the frequency of captures drops as time
                        goes by. Possible values are 'begin', 'end' and
                        'none'. (default is 'none')

== Style options ==
    --background=BACKGROUND
                        Background color (e.g. '#00ff00')
    --font-family=FONT_FAMILY
                        Path to TTF file for text
    --font-size=FONT_SIZE
                        Size of text in pixels
    --font-color=FONT_COLOR
                        Color of the text (e.g. 'black', '#000000')
    --heading-font-family=HEADING_FONT_FAMILY
                        Path to TTF file for heading
    --heading-font-size=HEADING_FONT_SIZE
                        Size of heading in pixels
    --heading-font-color=HEADING_COLOR
                        Color of the heading (e.g. 'black', '#000000')

== MPlayer Backend Options ==
Only necessary if you choose this backend.

    --path-mplayer=PATH_MPLAYER
                        Specify own path for 'mplayer' application (optional)
    --path-midentify=PATH_MIDENTIFY
                        Specify own path for 'midentify' application
                        (optional)
